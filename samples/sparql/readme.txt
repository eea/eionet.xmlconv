This folder contains sample XQuery and XSL scripts that use SPARQL to query RDF data from repositories.

   1. Demonstrate an XQuery that uses SPARQL to check whether a NUTS code reported in an XML file exists on  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/rdfdata/nuts2008.rdf
   2. Demonstrate an XSL-T script that uses SPARQL to get the label of a NUTS code
   3. Demonstrate an XQuery that uses SPARQL to find out which country a lat/long coordinate is located in using  http://converters.eionet.europa.eu/xmlfile/stations-min-max.xml. There is now a conversion to RDF at  http://converters.eionet.europa.eu/xsl/boundaries2rdf.xsl
