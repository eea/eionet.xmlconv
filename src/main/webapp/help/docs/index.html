<h1><a name="_Toc119909579"></a>1. General Principles</h1>
<p>The objective of the Data Conversion Module (DCM) is to improve automation of reporting and contribute to the development of a data exchange format in European level in order to ease exchange, enhance transparency and access to environmental information. This is accomplished by the conversion of delivered XML files to SQL scripts and to simple HTML tables. </p>
<p>DCM defines some terminology in order to describe the functionality of the application. The following terms are very common:</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc119909580">XML</a></h2>
<p>The Extensible Markup Language (XML) was designed to provide a means for information to be served, received, and processed on the Web in the way that is now possible with HTML.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc119909581"></a>SQL</h2>
<p>SQL stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a database and currently it is the standard language for relational database management systems.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc119909582"></a>REPORTNET Central Data Repository</h2>
<p>The CDR is a location where the deliveries of data files from countries are stored. This component is a content management system providing functions for uploads, downloads, versioning, approvals and sealing of official data sets, packaging in virtual envelopes for delivery, and tagging with meta-information.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc119909583"></a>REPORTNET Data Dictionary</h2>
<p>The Data Dictionary is a central storage for the technical specifications (definitions) of data requested in reporting obligations. It provides countries with detailed specifications of what to produce and report in a comparable manner. The DD makes use of an XML server for importing and exporting definitions.Â  </p>
<h2><a name="_Toc119909584"></a>User roles</h2>
<p>Roles are named groups of related privileges that REPORTNET Data Conversion Module grant to users or other roles. Access to the REPORTNET Data Conversion Module will be granted at 2 levels of users:</p>
<ol>
    <li>DCM Administrator: Is a registered user who is allowed to perform the DCM administrative operations. This user also includes privileges of the DCM User.</li>
    <li>DCM User: Is an anonyms user who is able to view and execute some of available conversions.</li>
</ol>
