CacheManager Configuration
==========================
An ehcache.xml corresponds to a single CacheManager.

See instructions below or the ehcache schema (ehcache.xsd) on how to configure.

System property tokens can be specified in this file which are replaced when the configuration
is loaded. For example multicastGroupPort=${multicastGroupPort} can be replaced with the
System property either from an environment variable or a system property specified with a
command line switch such as -DmulticastGroupPort=4446.

The attributes of <ehcache> are:
* name - an optional name for the CacheManager.  The name is optional and primarily used
for documentation or to distinguish Terracotta clustered cache state.  With Terracotta
clustered caches, a combination of CacheManager name and cache name uniquely identify a
particular cache store in the Terracotta clustered memory.
* updateCheck - an optional boolean flag specifying whether this CacheManager should check
for new versions of Ehcache over the Internet.  If not specified, updateCheck="true".
* monitoring - an optional setting that determines whether the CacheManager should
automatically register the SampledCacheMBean with the system MBean server.  Currently,
this monitoring is only useful when using Terracotta and thus the "autodetect" value
will detect the presence of Terracotta and register the MBean.  Other allowed values
are "on" and "off".  The default is "autodetect".

    Cache configuration
    ===================

    The following attributes are required.

    name:
    Sets the name of the cache. This is used to identify the cache. It must be unique.

    maxElementsInMemory:
    Sets the maximum number of objects that will be created in memory

    maxElementsOnDisk:
    Sets the maximum number of objects that will be maintained in the DiskStore
    The default value is zero, meaning unlimited.

    eternal:
    Sets whether elements are eternal. If eternal,  timeouts are ignored and the
    element is never expired.

    overflowToDisk:
    Sets whether elements can overflow to disk when the memory store
    has reached the maxInMemory limit.

    The following attributes and elements are optional.

    timeToIdleSeconds:
    Sets the time to idle for an element before it expires.
    i.e. The maximum amount of time between accesses before an element expires
    Is only used if the element is not eternal.
    Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that an Element can idle for infinity.
    The default value is 0.

    timeToLiveSeconds:
    Sets the time to live for an element before it expires.
    i.e. The maximum time between creation time and when an element expires.
    Is only used if the element is not eternal.
    Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that and Element can live for infinity.
    The default value is 0.

    diskPersistent:
    Whether the disk store persists between restarts of the Virtual Machine.
    The default value is false.

    diskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds:
    The number of seconds between runs of the disk expiry thread. The default value
    is 120 seconds.

    diskSpoolBufferSizeMB:
    This is the size to allocate the DiskStore for a spool buffer. Writes are made
    to this area and then asynchronously written to disk. The default size is 30MB.
    Each spool buffer is used only by its cache. If you get OutOfMemory errors consider
    lowering this value. To improve DiskStore performance consider increasing it. Trace level
    logging in the DiskStore will show if put back ups are occurring.

    clearOnFlush:
    whether the MemoryStore should be cleared when flush() is called on the cache.
    By default, this is true i.e. the MemoryStore is cleared.

    memoryStoreEvictionPolicy:
    Policy would be enforced upon reaching the maxElementsInMemory limit. Default
    policy is Least Recently Used (specified as LRU). Other policies available -
    First In First Out (specified as FIFO) and Less Frequently Used
    (specified as LFU)

    Cache elements can also contain sub elements which take the same format of a factory class
    and properties. Defined sub-elements are:

    * cacheEventListenerFactory - Enables registration of listeners for cache events, such as
      put, remove, update, and expire.

    * bootstrapCacheLoaderFactory - Specifies a BootstrapCacheLoader, which is called by a
      cache on initialisation to prepopulate itself.

    * cacheExtensionFactory - Specifies a CacheExtension, a generic mechansim to tie a class
      which holds a reference to a cache to the cache lifecycle.

    * cacheExceptionHandlerFactory - Specifies a CacheExceptionHandler, which is called when
      cache exceptions occur.

    * cacheLoaderFactory - Specifies a CacheLoader, which can be used both asynchronously and
      synchronously to load objects into a cache. More than one cacheLoaderFactory element
      can be added, in which case the loaders form a chain which are executed in order. If a
      loader returns null, the next in chain is called.



    Mandatory Default Cache configuration. These settings will be applied to caches
    created programmtically using CacheManager.add(String cacheName).

    The defaultCache has an implicit name "default" which is a reserved cache name.
